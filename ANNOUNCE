      GNU Pic Simulator, a simulator for 
      Microchip's PIC microcontrollers.


I've just uploaded a new release of gpsim to

http://www.dattalo.com/gnupic/gpsim-0.18.0.tar.gz
or goto the webpage:
http://www.dattalo.com/gnupic/gpsim.html

Also, you'll probably want to grab the latest release of gpasm
http://www.dattalo.com/gnupic/gpasm-0.8.7.tar.gz
(This is [still] an unofficial interim release of gpasm.)

New features:

03FEB00 gpsim-0.18.0
 o cli - added 'processor pins' command to display
         the state of a pic's I/O pins
 o cli - added 'set' command for modifying gpsim behavior
         flags. set options supported:
         -- verbose - if set, diagnostic info will be displayed
         -- radix - not supported yet
         -- gui_update - controls the rate at which the gui is refreshed
 o cli - added 's' option to the dump command to display only the
         special function registers (and not the rest of ram).
 o 18cxxx:
   -- TBLRD & TBLWT instructions are now supported
   -- MULLW & MULWF instructions are now supported
   -- configuration word support
   -- tmr0 interrupt
 o Cycle counter - 64 bits is now fully supported
 o config word bug fixed
 o gui - added Watch window
 o gui - added more color coding to register window
 o gui - removed stagnant menu selections
 o gui - window state is saved between gpsim sessions
   -- This requires a new package `eXdbm'.
 o getopt is now used to process invocation options (now you can
   have spaces between the options and file names).
 o support >64k object code in .cod files
 o gtksheet has been removed from the distribution
   -- This means that you'll have to install gtk+-extra, the
      package that supports gtk-sheet (see INSTALL)
 o .cod file format bug fixes (you'll need the latest gpasm)
 o __config word for 18cxxx family is now supported 



README:
------
Please see the README file for all of the details on the new features.

INSTALL:
-------
install gpsim the standard way:

tar -xvzf gpsim-0.18.0.tar.gz
./configure
cd gpsim-0.18.0/
make
su root
make install

this will expand into a child directory named gpsim-0.17.0 . From there you
can check the README, README.EXAMPLES, INSTALL, HISTORY, PROCESSORS and TODO
files for more information. The rest of the steps will build gpsim and place
the executable into /usr/local/bin . If you don't have root privileges then
you can copy the executable at gpsim-0.18.0/gpsim/gpsim to a directory in the
execution path .

Special Thanks (still) goes out to Ralf Forsberg for his major contributions
to the gui interface.
