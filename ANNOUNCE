README:
------
Please see the README file for all of the details on the new features.

INSTALL:
-------
install gpsim the standard way:

tar -xvzf gpsim-0.19.0.tar.gz
./configure
cd gpsim-0.19.0/
make
su root
make install

this will expand into a child directory named gpsim-0.19.0 . From there you
can check the README, README.EXAMPLES, INSTALL, HISTORY, PROCESSORS and TODO
files for more information. The rest of the steps will build gpsim and place
the executable into /usr/local/bin . If you don't have root privileges then
you can copy the executable at gpsim-0.19.0/gpsim/gpsim to a directory in the
execution path .

Special Thanks (still) goes out to Ralf Forsberg for his major contributions
to the gui interface. New thanks go out to Daniel Schudel for contributing
the 16C5X family.
