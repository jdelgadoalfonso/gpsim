      GNU Pic Simulator, a simulator for 
      Microchip's PIC microcontrollers.


I've just uploaded a new release of gpsim to

http://www.dattalo.com/gnupic/gpsim-0.21.0.tar.gz
or goto the webpage:
http://www.dattalo.com/gnupic/gpsim.html

Also, you'll probably want to grab the latest release of gpasm
http://gputils.sourceforge.net/

New features:


04JAN04 gpsim-0.21.1
  o Added the stopwatch command.
  o 18f1220 and 18f1320 added by Bradly McLean
  o EEPROM added to 18F devices by Mike Durian


README:
------
Please see the README file for all of the details on the new features.

INSTALL:
-------
install gpsim the standard way:

tar -xvzf gpsim-0.21.1.tar.gz
./configure
cd gpsim-0.20.1/
make
su root
make install

this will expand into a child directory named gpsim-0.21.0 . From there you
can check the README, README.EXAMPLES, INSTALL, HISTORY, PROCESSORS and TODO
files for more information. The rest of the steps will build gpsim and place
the executable into /usr/local/bin . If you don't have root privileges then
you can copy the executable at gpsim-0.20.0/gpsim/gpsim to a directory in the
execution path .

Also, don't forget to install eXdbm and gtk+extra. Please see the gpsim
web page for links to them.

Special Thanks (still) goes out to Ralf Forsberg for his major contributions
to the gui interface. Additional thanks goes to Joerg Wunsch in his support
for the BSD port. James Cameron deserves an honorable mention for telling me
about the strace command and about dlopen().
