And I know I'm probably missing others

README:
------
Please see the README file for all of the details on the new features.

INSTALL:
-------
install gpsim the standard way:

tar -xvzf gpsim-0.23.0.tar.gz
./configure
cd gpsim-0.23.0/
make
su root
make install

this will expand into a child directory named gpsim-0.23.0 . From there you
can check the README, README.EXAMPLES, INSTALL, HISTORY, PROCESSORS and TODO
files for more information. The rest of the steps will build gpsim and place
the executable into /usr/local/bin . If you don't have root privileges then
you can copy the executable at gpsim-0.20.0/gpsim/gpsim to a directory in the
execution path. Or better, check out INSTALL
