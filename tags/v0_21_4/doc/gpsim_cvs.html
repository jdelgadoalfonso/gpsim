<P>If you need to be on the bleeding edge, you can get the code straight from 

<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/gpsim/">gpsim's CVS repository</A>
on 
 <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=2341">gpsim's SourceForge Page</A>
,
which is of course hosted by
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>.
But <b>BE WARNED</b>, the CVS is development code and may be unstable! </P>

<h2> Getting the source</h2>
<P>
First you have to 'login' anonymously to the SorceForge CVS server. This doesn't do anything fancy other than
to tell SorceForge that you want to estabilish a link:
</P>
<pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gpsim login
</pre>
When prompted for a password, just press return. You don't need a pass word for anonymous access.
<p>
next, you need to checkout the files:
</p>
<pre>
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gpsim checkout .
</pre>
<p>
Don't forget the '.' (period) on the
end of the command. This tells cvs that you want everything. Keep in mind that 
this will download the code on your local computer in the directory from which the
command was launched. So you may wish to create a special directory (mkdir gpsim_cvs) and download the
code there.

</P>
<h2> Compiling your CVS copy the first time</h2
<p>
When you get the code from CVS this first time, you'll have to go through a
couple of extra steps to build it. But those steps are really simple. In the
directory you downloaded gpsim from CVS, enter these commands:
</p>
<pre>
$ libtoolize --force
$ aclocal
$ autoheader
$ automake --force-missing --add-missing
$ autoconf
$ ./configure
$ make
</pre>
<p>
Go get a cup of coffee and read <a href="http://slashdot.org">/.</a> as your computer cranks through compiling gpsim. When
it's done, you can then install it:
</p>
<pre>

$ su root
# make install
# exit
</pre>
<p>
And you should be ready to go!
</P>
<h2>Libraries and Modules</h2>
<p>
The instructions given above are suitable for building gpsim. However, it's
possible to embed gpsim into a custom simulation environment (see 
<a href="http://ktechlab.fadedminds.com/">KTechLab</a>). Chances are you'll
want to build a shared library instead of a static one. This can be accomplished
by specify --enable-shared as an option to the configure:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./configure --enable-shared
</pre>
<h2>Getting updates from CVS</h2>
<p>
If one of the developers makes a change to CVS and you just want to update your
local copy, then all you need to do is this:
</P>
<pre>
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gpsim update
</pre>
<p>
The 'update' command will compare your local copy with the master CVS copy and
then update your's with the differences. It's a whole faster than re-downloading
everything.
