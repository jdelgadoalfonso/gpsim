This directory contains a Makefile to generate rpm distributions of gpasm.  The 
objective is to automate to generation of rpms.  These files should not have 
to be modified between gpasm releases.

The makefile reads a spec file template (template.spec) then all strings 
enclosed by '@' are substituted.  The inserted data comes from configuration 
substitutions (PACKAGE = gpasm) or from environmental variables (NAME = Craig 
Franklin).  The following environmental variables must be set to generate a 
correct spec.

VARIABLE  	DESCRIPTION			EXAMPLE
NAME		Name of the Packager		Craig Franklin
EMAIL		Email address of Packager	<craigfranklin@home.com>

Instructions:
1.  "make spec" to generate an rpm spec file for the release. 

2.  Review the spec file.

3.  "make rpm" generates the rpm.
