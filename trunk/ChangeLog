	* Added 16f627,16f628 processors
	* log command has been added (Command Line)
	* Profiling has been added (gui)
	* Trace viewer has been added
	* Added parport - parallel port loadable module

	* Added "abort_gpsim_now" command. This will unconditionally abort gpsim.
	* Added "--cli" command line option. Invokes gpsim in command line 
	  mode even if it has been configured to use the gui.
	* Program viewer can now display ASCII encode text in "dt" tables
	* Symbolic setting of execution breaks was not working.
	* C++ bugs fixed
	* Fixed WDT during SLEEP bug reported by Tor Fredrik Aas mailto:tfa@abn.hibu.no
	* USART baud rates were generated incorrectly and have been fixed.
	* TXIF was handled improperly (reported by Wojciech Zabolotny <wzab@ise.pw.edu.pl>)
	* TMR1 was incrementing even when disabled (Reported by Wojciech)
	* Patch from JG for Suse 7.1. 
	* Patch from Robert Pearce to add 16C55
	* Sleep now works for 12c5xx.
	* Config word now works for 12c5xx
	* GPIO can wake a sleeping 12c5xx
	* Added pullup/pulldown resistors to the gpsim modules (idea from SET)
	* Numerous patches from from (SET) Salvador mailto:salvador@inti.gov.ar
	* SET - added "frequency" command
	* SET - Added time field to the gui status bar.
	* Carlos Nieves Ónega - Massive patch for the 17cxx core
	* Carlos Nieves Ónega - Registers for 17cxx core
	* From Salvador Eduardo Tropea mailto:salvador@inti.gov.ar
	  * Modified: In gpsim/main.cc put a cast in poptGetContext call, but perhaps
	    is a fault in the version I use of popt, double check it.
	  * Added: gtk_window_set_wmclass calls to help Enlightenment to remmember the
	   positions of the windows.     
	  * Added: In gui/gui_main.c a couple of #undef to avoid redefinitions in
	    eXdbm.h. Also check if that's OK for the eXdbm you are using.
	  * Modified: Moved the INTCON register from _14bit_18pins class to child
	    classes. That's because I needed to inherit from it and P16X6X_processor
	    and both defines INTCON. I also think things are more clear in this way.
	  * Fixed: A bug in the A/D routines. If you started a conversion at the same
	    time you were enabling the A/D this conversion was aborted. To fix it I
	    transfered new_value to value before calling start_conversion().
	  * Added: Partial support for 16C712 and 16C716 CPUs, they inherit from 14bits
	    18pins processors because they have 18 pins and also from 16x6x because
	    they have TMR1, TMR2 and Capture/Compare facilities like in 16C63. I could
	    check it deeply, just the A/D part. I also didn't implement the DATACCP and
	    TRISCCP registers, I don't know how they work, but I think they control the
	    use of some I/O pins (normal or CCP function).

     -- Iconic indicators (e.g. bitmaps indicating breaks, current pc...)
     -- Multiple sources
   - Significant restructuring of the gpsim to gui interface

  o Added support for the 12c508 and 12c509
  o Bug Fixes:
     - DC bit wasn't updated correctly in add's and sub's (if W was the destination)
     - stack was rolling over after 7 pushes
     - goto's and call's were limited to 10 bits
  o Added the command line option '-v' and the command version. Both echo 
    gpsim's version.
  o Enhanced 'it.asm' and added 'it_12bit.asm' - two routines that exercise
    gpsim's ability to simulate the pic instructions.
  o Added a trace for skipped instructions (before you'd see skipped instructions
    the same as non skipped ones in the trace buffer).


16NOV98 gpsim-0.0.8

  o Changed the command line invocation: -p now selects a processor and not a core (e.g. -p14 used to be the way gp
sim liked to select a device within the midrange, 14-bit family; now you must specify the specific device you wish 
to simulate: -pp16c61 .)
  o Generally overhauled everything in anticipation of supporting the 12-bit core
