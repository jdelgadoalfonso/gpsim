<P>If you need to be on the bleeding edge, you can get the code straight from

<a href="http://gpsim.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/gpsim/trunk/">gpsim's SVN repository</A>
on
 <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gpsim/">gpsim's SourceForge Page</A>
 ,
 which is of course hosted by
 <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>.
 But <b>BE WARNED</b>, the SVN is development code and may be unstable!
 </P>

<h2> Getting the source</h2>


<P>
<pre>
$ mkdir gpsim  # or whatever directory name you prefer
$ cd gpsim
$ svn checkout https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gpsim/trunk .
</pre>



Note, don't forget the '.' at the end of the last command! If you did,
then the code will get placed into a directory named gpsim/trunk. Also,
note that svn is chunky around the edges; you'll need about 45M of disc
space to get a copy of the reposistory. Actually, the 'trunk' is where the
latest code is stored. The whole repository is a third of a gig!

</P>
<h2> Compiling your SVN copy the first time</h2
<p>
When you get the code from SVN this first time, you'll have to go through a
couple of extra steps to build it. But those steps are really simple. In the
directory you downloaded gpsim from SVN, enter these commands:
</p>
<pre>
$ libtoolize --force
$ aclocal
$ autoheader
$ automake --force-missing --add-missing
$ autoconf
$ ./configure
$ make
</pre>
<p>
Go get a cup of coffee and read <a href="http://slashdot.org">/.</a> as your computer cranks through compiling gpsim. When
it's done, you can then install it:
</p>
<pre>

$ su root
# make install
# exit
</pre>
<p>
And you should be ready to go!
</P>
<h2>Extra Build Details</h2>
<p>The instructions given above are suitable for building gpsim. However, it's
possible to embed gpsim into a custom simulation environment (see
<a href="http://ktechlab.org/">KTechLab</a>). These simulation environments
may have special requirements for building or configuring gpsim. For example, if
shared libraries required:
</p>
<p>
  <pre>
 [gpsim] $ ./configure --enable-shared
  </pre>
</p>

<p>
Or if the socket interface is required:
</p>

<p>
  <pre>
 [gpsim] $ ./configure --enable-sockets
  </pre>
</p>

<h2>Building Libraries and Modules</h2>

<p>
  The main gpsim source contains several simple library modules. When you build
and install gpsim these are installed too. These modules are placed into a shared library
(or DLL under windows). Thus gpsim will use your OS' library loading mechanism to find
them. A common mistake here is that the modules get installed into a directory for which
the OS has no path. On Linux, the modules are installed by default into /usr/local/lib/.
If you choose to keep this default location (there's nothing wrong with that), you'll need to
add a path to it. This is done by placing adding the path to the file /etc/ld.so.conf

</p>
<p>
<pre>
 $ su    # become root
 # edit /etc/ld.so.conf  by adding the line /usr/local/lib to it
 # cat /etc/ld.so.conf
include ld.so.conf.d/*.conf
/usr/X11R6/lib
/usr/X11R6/lib64
/usr/lib/mysql
/usr/lib64/mysql
/usr/local/lib
 # /sbin/ldconfig    # refresh the cached library search paths
 # exit
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Getting updates from SVN</h2>
<p>
If one of the developers makes a change to SVN and you just want to update your
local copy, then all you need to do is this:
</P>
<pre>
svn  update
</pre>
<p>
The 'update' command will compare your local copy with the master SVN copy and
then update your's with the differences. It's a whole faster than re-downloading
everything.
